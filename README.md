## ðŸ›‘ Problem

When disasters like floods, earthquakes, or cyclones strike:

- Relief funds often **arrive too late** â€” victims wait days or weeks for help.  
- Distribution is slowed by **lengthy fundraising, verification, and bureaucracy**.  
- Aid is often given **equally to everyone**, ignoring that some families are hit harder than others.  
- Donors have **no clear visibility** into how their money is spent.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution

The **Avalanche Disaster Relief Network** solves these issues by:

1. **Pre-Funded Relief Vault**  
   - Donors contribute **before disasters happen**.  
   - Funds are kept in **secure, instantly available investments** until needed.

2. **Rapid Payouts**  
   - **Trusted data sources** and **authority approvals** trigger payouts **within hours**.  
   - Direct transfers to **bank accounts, UPI, mobile wallets, or blockchain wallets**.

3. **Two-Phase Aid Distribution**  
   - **Phase 1:** Equal emergency payouts for all affected individuals.  
   - **Phase 2:** Weighted payouts for families **most severely impacted**.

4. **Full Transparency**  
   - Every payout is **recorded on Avalancheâ€™s public ledger**.  
   - Donors can **track funds in real time** and **view proof of aid**.
